Welcome to day 1 of wavytropics practical session. In this notebook, you will learn how to:

1. Get the real-time multivariate MJO index (RMM) for the MJO activity.
2. Get the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) data and calculate the daily anomalies.
3. Choose the seasons in the data and list dates for each phase of the MJO.
4. Create OLR anomaly composites for the MJO.

In addition:
1. Get the index for ENSO and pair it with the MJO index.
2. Create OLR anomaly composites during the La-Nina/El-Nino for each phase of the MJO.

The OLR data acts as the proxy for convection. A high negative anomaly indicates a deep convection and vice versa. In this notebook, we will plot the composites for each phase and compare the MJO convective activity during El-Nino/La-Nina vs All days.
